# Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV-Python
This project implements face detection using Python and OpenCV with the Haar Cascade Classifier.  It detects multiple human faces in an image, converts the image to grayscale for processing,  and draws bounding boxes around detected faces.  A beginner-friendly computer vision project to understand image processing and object detection.
